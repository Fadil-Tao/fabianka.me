Hi! I'm Fabian â€” a software engineer and computer science student with big amount of interest in the field. This website is a collection of blog posts documenting my learning journey as I build (and occasionally break) things along the way. 

Currently my focus learning is Machine Learning especially Reinforcement Learning and Distributed System.
